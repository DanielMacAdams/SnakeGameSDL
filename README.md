# SnakeGameSDL

## game rules:
1. The snake should be able to follow its own tail with no space in between
2. Quit the game if the head collides with any other part of the snake
3. When the snake eats an apple, the background should not be drawn over the last tail as the snake is growing in size
    in this case, no updates should be made to variables related to the tail
